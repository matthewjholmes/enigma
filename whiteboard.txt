ENIGMA
  methods
    encrypt - output hash
    decrypt - output hash


      If you encounter a character not in the character set, it should be translated as itself. Using the example above, “hello world!” should be translated as “keder ohulw!”

  Refactor notes:
    structure classes for single responsibility
    module opportunities for encrypter/decrypter (h.invert)
    encrypt/decrypt (though decrypt always needs key)
    shorten or break out inot more helper methods message char shift groups
    File I/O--does this refer to reading and writing to/from files from CLI?



  Before submission, need to add README to include evaluation rubric

  Nice to have: have a CLI that allows use of both encryption and decryption, storage of past messages, etc.
